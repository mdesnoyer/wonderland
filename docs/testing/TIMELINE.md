# Timeline Testing by Ed Henderson

This is very much work in progress. Please ask if you have any questions.

## IGN

1. Goto https://staging-app.neon-lab.com/timeline/ign/ (we use this because its always got new stuff coming in)
2. Let it load (with loading overlay)
3. Make sure there are no console errors
4. Make sure it refreshes every X seconds (you&#39;ll see the spinner in the top right) and (if applicable) new content comes in
5. The IGN Timeline has the Neonscores visible
6. The IGN Timeline has a Threshold so there should be no image &lt; 50.
7. Clicking any Thumbnail should download the hi-res version of it
8. Make the viewport smaller / use a mobile device, the same functionality should be available (the number of thumbs should drop from 3 to 2 in small viewports)

## Oracle 2016 A

1. Goto https://staging-app.neon-lab.com/timeline/oracle2016a/
2. Let it load (with loading overlay)
3. Make sure there are no console errors
4. Make sure it refreshes every X seconds (you&#39;ll see the spinner in the top right) and (if applicable) new content comes in (for the moment it will not load new content unless the backend script is run)
5. The Oracle 2016 A Timeline has the Neonscores hidden, they should not be shown
6. The Oracle 2016 A Timeline has no Threshold so you should see ALL images
7. Clicking any Thumbnail should download the hi-res version of it
8. Make the viewport smaller / use a mobile device, the same functionality should be available (the number of thumbs should drop from 3 to 2 in small viewports)

## Oracle 2016 B

As above, but:

1. Goto https://staging-app.neon-lab.com/timeline/oracle2016b/

END
