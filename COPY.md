Welcome to Neon
the amazing tool that can actually get you more clicks on your video content.

How it Works
Based on 10 years of human behavioral research, Neon scans a video and finds the frames that users will most want to click on. Surprisingly, these are not necessarily the "best" or the prettiest frames. Neon evaluates each frame for features which generate emotional attraction (such as faces, attention, color, symmetry, blurriness, etc. ) and then returns the ones that are the most "clickable."

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Enter the address of the video you want to analyze.
2. Enter an optional title that you can use to identify it later.
3. Press the UPLOAD button.
Your video will be processed and the top-scoring thumbnails identified.

(The processing time depends on the length of the video. It takes our computers about the same amount of time to watch a video as it takes you, so longer videos take a while.)

The following 6 thumbnails were identified as the most "clickable" frames in this video.

Not the ones you would have picked?
That's not surprising. The prettiest images are usually NOT the ones that generate the most clicks. 

These images were selected by measuring features which generate emotional attraction within 20 to 50 milliseconds; features such as faces, attention, color, symmetry, blurriness, and others.

70% of the time, Neon finds images that significantly outperform those chosen by human editors.
